RRegrs
======

The current tool is a collection of regression tools from R that could be used for searching the best regression models for any dataset. The initial use of the script is finding QSAR models for chemoinformatics / nanotoxicology.

The full R script will contain:
1) Loading dataset
2) Filter dataset
3) Scaling dataset
4) Feature selection (optional)
5) Regression models
6) Summary with top models
7) Statistics of the best model

The script will be modular in order to create flexible APIs.

The main authors are part of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) and Maastricht University (UM) as nodes of the EU eNanoMapper project.
