General:
- check the appends in order to create a new output file for each new calculation
- Add a parallel package depending on the operating system
- catch the errors in each step
- check the null results, etc.

Particular:
- step 1 = reading ds: the names of features are changed!


Errors:
- with ds.House2.csv, the training and test files contain only one column! It seamns that there are errors into the splitting

- Lasso error

Loading required package: pROC
Error in plot.window(...) : need finite 'xlim' values
In addition: There were 50 or more warnings (use warnings() to see the first 50)

- error if you restart a calculation
